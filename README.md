Task -2(image gallery)

Overview of the Project:-

HTML 
   - The gallery consists of a container with multiple image panels.
   - Each panel has an image set as the background and a title.

   CSS
   - Images are styled to cover the entire panel with responsive resizing.
   - Flexbox is used to align the panels and allow them to expand when clicked.
   
     JavaScript 
   - When a panel is clicked, it becomes active by adding the "active" class.
   - The `removeActiveClasses()` function ensures only one panel is active at a time.
   - The panels dynamically resize and adjust their content visibility based on user interaction.

Responsiveness
   - The media query hides some panels on smaller screens to ensure the layout stays clean on mobile devices.

This project demonstrates the use of interactive elements, responsive design, and animations in web development.
